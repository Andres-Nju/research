Fixes incorrect comment. (#10913)

I _believe_ (someone please double-check my work) that this comment is subtly incorrect and in fact the replacement will occur if the new gas price is exactly 12.5% (given current configuration) higher.

Relevant pieces of code:
```rust
fn bump_gas_price(old_gp: U256) -> U256 {
	old_gp.saturating_add(old_gp >> GAS_PRICE_BUMP_SHIFT)
}
```
```rust
let min_required_gp = bump_gas_price(*old_gp);
match min_required_gp.cmp(&new_gp) {
	cmp::Ordering::Greater => scoring::Choice::RejectNew,
	_ => scoring::Choice::ReplaceOld,
}
```

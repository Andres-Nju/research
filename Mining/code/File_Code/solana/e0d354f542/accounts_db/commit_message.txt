fix bug in test fn compare_all_accounts (#30217)

#### Problem
test code compares sets of accounts after clean/shrink operations.
The indexing was off and new tests were giving false positives.
The test code was equivalent as long as everything was in the same
order.

#### Summary of Changes
Fix test code comparison indexes.

fix small doc mistake

The std::io::read main documentation can lead to error because the
buffer is prefilled with 10 zeros that will pad the response.
Using an empty vector is better.

The `read_to_end` documentation is already correct though.

This is my first rust PR, don't hesitate to tell me if I did something
wrong.

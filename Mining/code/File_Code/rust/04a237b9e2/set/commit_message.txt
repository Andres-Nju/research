Fix HashSet::union performance

Consider this example: small_set = 0..2, large_set = 0..1000.

To efficiently compute the union of these sets, we should
* take all elements of the larger set
* for each element of the smaller set check it is not in the larger set

This is exactly what this commit does.

This particular optimization was implemented a year ago, but the
author mistaken `<` and `>`.

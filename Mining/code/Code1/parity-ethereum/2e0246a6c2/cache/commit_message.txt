Fix: test corpus_inaccessible panic (#10019)

If system uptime is less than the duration in the test, thread
will panic due to: 'overflow when subtracting duration from instant'.

Changed duration to 20 seconds to make it unlikely the test will
fail due to this condition.

Since no operations that carry a similar risk of panic occur outside
of the tests, it doesn't seem warranted to depend on an external crate
to fix this.

    /// Returns the length of this stream (in bytes).
    ///
    /// This method is implemented using up to three seek operations. If this
    /// method returns successfully, the seek position is unchanged (i.e. the
    /// position before calling this method is the same as afterwards).
    /// However, if this method returns an error, the seek position is
    /// unspecified.
    ///
    /// If you need to obtain the length of *many* streams and you don't care
    /// about the seek position afterwards, you can reduce the number of seek
    /// operations by simply calling `seek(SeekFrom::End(0))` and using its
    /// return value (it is also the stream length).
    ///
    /// Note that length of a stream can change over time (for example, when
    /// data is appended to a file). So calling this method multiple times does
    /// not necessarily return the same length each time.
    ///
    ///
    /// # Example
    ///
    /// ```no_run
    /// #![feature(seek_convenience)]
    /// use std::{
    ///     io::{self, Seek},
    ///     fs::File,
    /// };
    ///
    /// fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    ///     let mut f = File::open("foo.txt")?;
    ///
    ///     let len = f.stream_len()?;
    ///     println!("The file is currently {} bytes long", len);
    ///     Ok(())
    /// }
    /// ```

std: use more portable error number in from_raw_os_error docs

On MIPS, error number 98 is not EADDRINUSE (it is EPROTOTYPE). To fix the
resulting test failure this causes, use a more portable error number in
the example documentation. EINVAL shold be more reliable because it was
defined in the original Unix as 22 so hopefully most derivatives have
defined it the same way.

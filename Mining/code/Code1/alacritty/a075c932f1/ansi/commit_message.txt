Fix `OSC 52` with empty clipboard param

This fixes the behavior of the clipboard escape (`OSC 52`) when the
second parameter is not specified. If it is missing, the parameter is
now assumed to be `c`, defaulting to the default clipboard.

This has been fixed both for writing and reading.

Fixes #3037.

Fix dimming of indexed colors

It seems like the list of colors might have changed a bit, leading to
indexed colors not being transformed into their dim colors correctly.

To prevent this from happening in the future, the dimming for colors in
the range '0..=7' is now performed by offsetting them from the
'NamedColor::DimBlack'. Since this is the first dimmed color, this
should always work as long as all dimmed colors are added in the correct
order.

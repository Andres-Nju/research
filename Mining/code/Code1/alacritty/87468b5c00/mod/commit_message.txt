Fix newline + scroll region bug (#747)

When a scroll region is active with the cursor below the bottom of the
region, newlines should not cause the region to scroll.

A ref test was added for this situation to prevent regressions.

Thanks @hiciu for reporting and @nicm for the test case.

Resolves #745.

Fix build failure on 32-bit machines

Alacritty has some checks in place to make sure that unsafe
code would not fail because of invalid struct sizes. This managed
to successfully catch an incorrect unsafe block on 32-bit machines.

To make sure this block works on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems,
it has been altered to make use of the platform-dependent `usize`
type. This will always make use of correct sizes without having to
rely on conditional compilation.

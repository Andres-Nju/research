fix syntax error in bash_profile

if there is no newline at the end of the file, this export is glued to the rest of the code and generates a syntax error like this

```bash
if [ -f ~/.git-completion.bash ]; then
  . ~/.git-completion.bash
fiexport PATH="/Users/user/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"
```

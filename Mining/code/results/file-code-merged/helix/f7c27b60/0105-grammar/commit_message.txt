Ignore SendErrors when handling grammars (#2641)

When handling grammars, fetching and building is done in a thread
pool.  Results are communicated over channels and the receiving
channel is closed on first error. This causes subsequent sends to
fail causing a mess in stderr. This ignores all SendErrors causing
only the first error to be printed.

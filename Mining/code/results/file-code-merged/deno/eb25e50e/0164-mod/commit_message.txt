fix(cli): restore `deno run -` to handle stdin as typescript (#18391)

Bug reported here shortly after merging `--ext` changes
https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/17172#issuecomment-1480898098

Also found a missing `--check` in integration tests for `--ext` that
would have missed a bug if there was one.

Fixes #18392

fix: base64 encoding of source maps with emojis (#14607)

This commit fixes source maps for files that contain emojis.

This is done by updating "deno_ast" to "0.14.1" for the case
of "--no-check" flag (ie using SWC emit) and by overriding
TSC's default base64 encoder (which turned out to be buggy)
for the type checking case.

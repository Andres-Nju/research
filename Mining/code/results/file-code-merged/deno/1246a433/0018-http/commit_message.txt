fix: poll connection after writing response chunk in Deno.serveHttp() (#10961)

This commit changes "op_http_response_write" to first send response chunk
and then poll the underlying HTTP connection.

Previously after writing a chunk of response HTTP connection wasn't polled
and thus data wasn't written to the socket until after next op interacting 
with the connection.

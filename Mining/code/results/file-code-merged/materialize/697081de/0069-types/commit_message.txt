dataflow-types: make `metadata_columns` and `metadata_column_types` agree

These two functions are tightly coupled and need to make the same
decision about which metadata columns exist given the same input.  Prior
to this commit, `metadata_columns` would elide Kafka's default metadata
if an offset was explicitly specified, but `metadata_column_types` would
not. This disparity caused #12005.

`metadata_columns` was making the right decision here (i.e., the ones
that our tests expect), so change `metadata_column_types` to match.

On a meta level, the way this code is structured is a recipe for bugs of
this form. I'm sure there are more lurking. We need to get on #11957
ASAP.

Fix #12005.

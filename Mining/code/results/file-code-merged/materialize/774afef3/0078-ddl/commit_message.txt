sql: fix logic error in cluster drop check (#13366)

This commit fixes a bug in the logic that decides whether a cluster has
active items. Prior to this change, as cluster could be dropped when it
had no exports (even if it had replicas) or when it had no replicas
(even if it had exports), leaving catalog items that referred to a
non-existing cluster.

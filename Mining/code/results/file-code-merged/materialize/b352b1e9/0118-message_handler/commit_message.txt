adapter: drop linked cluster if sink fails to create

If a sink fails to create in the external system (e.g., because the
Kafka broker rejects the topic configuration), we need to remove both
the sink *and* the linked cluster associated with the sink. Teach the
sink cleanup code path to handle this.

Fix #17061.

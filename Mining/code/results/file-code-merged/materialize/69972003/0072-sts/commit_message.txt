Fix AWS timeout warnings in console logs (#9642)

Currently we get the following warning tens of times every time an AWS source
starts up, or re-does anything:

    2021-12-15T16:29:50.908164Z  WARN aws_smithy_client::timeout: One or more timeouts were set but no async_sleep fn was passed. No timeouts will occur.
    Timeouts:
    Connect (time to first byte):(unset)
    TLS negotiation:(unset)
    HTTP read:(unset)
    API requests:(unset)
    HTTP requests:(unset)

In the future (when the upstream issue[1] is fixed) it may be possible to get
the default behavior by just enabling the `tokio-rt` feature. However, right
now that doesn't work, and possibly when it is fixed we won't want to tie
ourselves to that feature.

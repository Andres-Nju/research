compute: fix UpdateNotBeyondLower errors in persist_sink

These errors happened with multiple replicas writing to the same sink.
Since we used `lower = write.upper()`, it was possible that some times
we tried to append were below our specified `lower`, when other replicas
had advanced `write.upper()` since our last append.

This is fixed by setting `lower` to our per-replica sink frontier, which
is not affected by other replicas writing to the same sink.

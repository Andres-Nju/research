trace: fix level_span macros not propagating parents (#1167)

Currently, when the `trace_span!`, `debug_span!`, `info_span!`,
`warn_span!`, and `error_span!` macros are invoked with an explicit
parent, a name, and zero or more fields (no target), the macros don't
pass along the explicitly provided parent when expanding to the `span!`
macro. This is likely due to an oversight on my part.

This branch fixes these macros by adding the parent into the `span!`
macro expansion. I've also added a test to catch regressions

Shoutout to @jonhoo for catching this one!

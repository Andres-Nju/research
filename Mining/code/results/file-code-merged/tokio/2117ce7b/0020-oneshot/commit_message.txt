sync: fix mem leak in oneshot on task migration (#1649)

When polling the task, the current waker is saved to the oneshot state.
When the handle is migrated to a new task and polled again, the waker
must be swaped from the old waker to the new waker. In some cases, there
is a potential for the old waker to leak.

This bug was caught by loom with the recently added memory leak
detection.

Backport of #1648.

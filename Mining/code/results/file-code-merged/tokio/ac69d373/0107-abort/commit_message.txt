task: fix broken link in `AbortHandle` RustDoc (#4545)

## Motivation

There's a broken docs link in the docs for `AbortHandle`. Somehow this
managed to slip past CI yesterday when #4530 was merged
(https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/runs/5325278596?check_suite_focus=true)
but it's breaking the build now
(https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/runs/5337182732?check_suite_focus=true)
which seems really weird to me, but...whatever...

## Solution

This branch fixes the broken link lol.

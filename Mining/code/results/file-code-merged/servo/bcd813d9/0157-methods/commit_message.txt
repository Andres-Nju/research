Fix fetching about:blank

When fetching about:blank, response body should be the empty byte
sequence.
Spec: https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-basic-fetch

Before this change, response body would be set to `ResponseBody::Empty`,
and then fetching would result in an infinite loop at step 19 in fn
`main_fetch` (methods.rs).

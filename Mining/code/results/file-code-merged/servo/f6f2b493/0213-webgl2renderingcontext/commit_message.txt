Auto merge of #26143 - jdm:transform-feedback, r=nox

Fix webgl transform feedback

This allows https://www.joshmatthews.net/webxr-particles/ to run in Servo. This change corresponds with the following spec text:
```
GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated by glBeginTransformFeedback if no binding points would be used, either because no program object is active of because the active program object has specified no varying variables to record.
```

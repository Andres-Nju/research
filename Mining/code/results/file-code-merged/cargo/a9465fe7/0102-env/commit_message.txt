Build by PackageIdSpec, not name, to avoid ambiguity

### What does this PR try to resolve?

Fixes #11999

I previously added this code to ensure `cargo install` will build the intended package, but it turns out to cause ambiguity in the case where a package depends on prior versions of itself.

This ambiguity can be resolved by identifying the package to build by its pkg-spec, not name.

### How should we test and review this PR?

A test case is included.

I have additionally manually tested that, with this patch, the issue in #11999 is fixed and now installs correctly.

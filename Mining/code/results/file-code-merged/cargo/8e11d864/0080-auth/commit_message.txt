Fix Cargo warning about unused sparse configuration key

When doing a credential lookup, Cargo deserializes the registry configuration and detects the `registries.crates-io.protocol` key as unused and issues a warning:
```
warning: unused config key `registries.crates-io.protocol` in [..]
```

This fixes the issue by adding the field to the `RegistryConfig` struct.

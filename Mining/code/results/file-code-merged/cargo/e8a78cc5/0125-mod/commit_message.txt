Auto merge of #9789 - ehuss:fix-value-after-table-profile, r=alexcrichton

Fix value-after-table error with profiles.

If the `strip`, `dir-name`, or `inherits` fields were included along with a profile override, then `cargo publish` would fail with a `ValueAfterTable` error because the fields were listed in the wrong order in the struct definition.

Fixes #9787

Fix failing test with `bench` feature

Using the `bench` feature, `cargo test` was failing since one of the
benchmarks was running into a debug assertion for attempting to access a
line with an index beyond the grid length.

Since this issue was caused by the `len` property not being serialized
and deserialized, the `#[serde(skip)]` attribute has been changed to
`#[serde(default)]`. The ref-test has been edited to include the correct
grid length for proper deserialization.

This fixes #1604.

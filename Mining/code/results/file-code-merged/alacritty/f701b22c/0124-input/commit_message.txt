Fix cursor reports with mouse outside of window

Previously Alacritty would not report cursor escapes to the application
when a mouse button was held down and the mouse was moved. This prevents
applications like tmux from updating their selection.

Similarly to how windowing libraries keep reporting mouse events when
the left mouse button is held down over the window, the escape sequences
are now clamped to within the grid and reported to applications.

Fixes #4566.

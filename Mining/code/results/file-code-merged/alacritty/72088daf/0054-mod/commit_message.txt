Fix inconsitent cursor position when scrolling

This commit fixes regression introduced in cfc20d4f34dca535654cc32df18e785296af4cc5.
`self.cursor.line` forced the cursor to hold a fixed location while scrolling
until its "original" location (usually the shell prompt) went off the screen.
So cursor position should be keep updated, which can be achieved by using
`self.inner.line()`.

Fixes #2570.

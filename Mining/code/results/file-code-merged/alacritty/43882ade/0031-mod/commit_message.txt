Fix substraction underflow with IL sequence

The IL escape sequence (CSI Ps L) allows inserting blank, uninitialized
lines. `Ps` is a placeholder for the number of lines that should be
inserted. Before this change Alacritty would crash when a large number
of lines was passed as `Ps` parameter.

The issue was caused whenever the current line of the cursor plus the
lines that should be inserted would leave the bottom of the terminal,
since this makes indexing impossible.

This patch makes sure that the biggest amount of lines inserted does
never exceed the end of the visible region minus the current line of the
curser, which fixes the underflow issue.

This fixes #1515.

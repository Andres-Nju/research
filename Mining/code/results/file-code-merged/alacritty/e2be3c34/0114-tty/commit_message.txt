Remove incorrect close (#552)

Ownership of the slave file descriptor is passed to the process::Stdio
structs and will be closed when they are dropped. If the slave fd is
closed explicitly then the next fd that is opened during the same scope
will get silently closed by the Stdio structs when they are dropped.

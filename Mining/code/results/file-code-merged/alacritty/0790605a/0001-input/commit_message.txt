Fix characters getting swallowed during IME input

This reverts 1d00883 since it is not necessary anymore after all search
bindings are now proper key bindings. This fixes a bug which would cause
the first character to be swallowed when using IME after triggering any
key binding which doesn't send any `ReceivedCharacter` event.

Fixes #4588.

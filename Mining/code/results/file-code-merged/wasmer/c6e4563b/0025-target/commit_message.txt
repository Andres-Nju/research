Merge #1602

1602: Fix bug relating to type conversion in function calls r=MarkMcCaskey a=MarkMcCaskey

resolves #1596 

I attempted to use constant expressions so we didn't have to duplicate the macro, but `std::mem::transmute` is a compile error if you attempt to transmute from A to B where size_of(A) != size_of(B), even if it's in a branch like `if false`

# Review

- [x] Add a short description of the the change to the CHANGELOG.md file

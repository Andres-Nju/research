avm2: Fix handling of completed timers

It's possible to call 'start()' on a timer
that has currentCount >= repeatCount. This will
cause the timer to tick exactly once, and then stop agian.

We were incorrectly reporting 'timer.running' in such a scenario:
'running' should be reported as 'true' up until just before the
'TimerEvent.TIMER_COMPLETE' is fired.

This fixes gaining money from bloon popping / level completion
in BTD5.

copr: return memory locks correctly in replica read (#12388)

close tikv/tikv#12341

The memory lock returned from the leader in replica read is a
tikv_kv::ErrorInner::KeyIsLocked. The conversion from this error to
coprocessor::Error is not implemented, so this error is finally turned
to an other error, which cannot be correctly handled in TiDB.

This commit implements the missing conversion. Now, the memory
lock will be correctly set in the `locked` field in the response.

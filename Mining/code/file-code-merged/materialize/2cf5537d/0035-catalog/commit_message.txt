sql: fix DROP CASCADE bug (#5375)

A user found that DROP ... CASCADE of multiple objects--where those
objects have dependent objects in common--failed. This was reported
in #5316.

The fix is to deduplicate the internal drop operations created by a
single DROP statement, ensuring that we only attempt to drop the common
dependent objects once.

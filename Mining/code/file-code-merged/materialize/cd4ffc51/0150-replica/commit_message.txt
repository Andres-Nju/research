compute-client: retry connecting to replicas more eagerly

This commit changes the replica connection retry behavior from
exponential backoff to retrying every second. The rationale is:

 1. Retrying more eagerly reduces the delay until the replica is
    functional. This is particularly relevant for tests.
 2. Retrying more eagerly should not cause any harm since on request per
    second is still low traffic.
 3. This is the same behavior as the storage client uses to connect to
    replicas.

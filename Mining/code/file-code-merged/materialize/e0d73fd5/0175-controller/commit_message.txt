storage: Change error log to warn (#17430)

As part of the builtin migrations, the adapter may ask the storage
controller to drop a source/sink that may not exist. Previously in
those cases, the storage controller would log an error even though it
was expected that the source/sink may not exist. This commit changes
error log to a warn log.

Fixes #16612

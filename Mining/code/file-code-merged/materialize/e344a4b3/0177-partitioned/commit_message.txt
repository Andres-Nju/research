Remove seemingly dubious logic from `Partitioned::recv`. (#12269)

Returning `Ok(None)` here signals end of stream; clients might never
poll the stream again, and thus might never be notified of an error.

Instead we should mirror the logic in the `Ok` branch -- continue
processing messages until we have enough information to return an
error.

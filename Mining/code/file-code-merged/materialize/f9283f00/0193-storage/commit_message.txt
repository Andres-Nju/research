test: Deflake storage usage test (#18387)

This commit de- flakes the
test_old_storage_usage_records_are_reaped_on_restart test. Previously,
the test would

  1. Start Materialize.
  2. Wait for some storage usage collection to happen.
  3. Stop Materialize.
  4. Sleep for the retention period.
  5. Start Materialize.
  6. Assert that there are no storage usage metrics.

There was a race condition between steps (5) and (6) where Materialize
could generate new storage usage metrics after the restart and the
assert would fail.

This commit alters the logic to assert that the maximum timestamp from
all storage usage metrics before the restart is less than the minimum
timestamp from all storage usage metrics after the restart, which
avoids the race condition.

This commit also switches from using sleeps to using deterministic
timestamps in order to be more deterministic and consistent.

Fixes #18108

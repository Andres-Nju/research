planner: Fix function column name invention (#19874)

Previously, in the planner when inventing a column name for the result
of certain functions we would check if the schema id of the function
matched the schema id of the mz_internal schema. When looking up the
schema id of the mz_internal schema, we would mistakenly look for it in
the materialize database. If someone deleted the materialize database,
this code path would cause a panic.

This commit fixes this logic to look for the mz_internal schema in the
ambient database which avoids the panic when the materialize database
doesn't exist.

Fixes #19871

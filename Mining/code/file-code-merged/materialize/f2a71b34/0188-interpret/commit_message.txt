FIX: don't use the associative path for single arguments

The existing implementation was essentially a passthrough.  This is fine
in all cases except for `concat`, which converts nulls to empty strings.

There's no benefit in using this opimization for short argument lists, and
clearly it has some cost. Punt single-argument arg lists to the general
version.

test(aws): Ignore tests that check .aws files (#1775)

When running the AWS module it will parse the AWS config found in
`~/.aws/config` to get the region. This means that tests that expect no
region to be set will fail if there exists a default profile with a
region set, which is probably true for most AWS users. To avoid this
have set the AWS tests that depend on the non-existance of a
`.aws/config` to be ignored.

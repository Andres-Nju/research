Add shift-backspace keybind alias for backspace (#4937)

When the Kitty Keyboard Protocol is enabled, S-backspace is
distinguished from backspace with no modifiers. This is awkward when
typing because it's very easy to accidentally hold shift and press
backspace temporarily when typing capital letters.

Kakoune (which is also a Kitty Keyboard Protocol application) treats
S-backspace as backspace too:

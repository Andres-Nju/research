Fix panic when moving over unicode punctuation

`is_ascii_punctuation` will only work for ASCII punctuations, and when
we have unicode punctuation (or other) we jump into the `unreachable`.
This patch fallback into categorizing everything in this branch as
`Unknown`.

https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/135: add better support for
unicode categories.

Fix Golang textobject queries (#2153)

* log textobject query construction errors

The current behavior is that invalid queries are discarded silently
which makes it difficult to debug invalid textobjects (either invalid
syntax or an update may have come through that changed the valid set
of nodes).

* fix golang textobject query

`method_spec_list` used to be a named node but was removed (I think
for Helix, it was when updated to pull in the support for generics).
Instead of a named node for the list of method specs we have a bunch
of `method_spec` children nodes now. We can match on the set of them
with a `+` wildcard.

Example go for this query:

    type Shape interface {
       area() float64
       perimeter() float64
    }

Which is parsed as:

    (source_file
      (type_declaration
        (type_spec
          name: (type_identifier)
          type: (interface_type
            (method_spec
              name: (field_identifier)
              parameters: (parameter_list)
              result: (type_identifier))
            (method_spec
              name: (field_identifier)
              parameters: (parameter_list)
              result: (type_identifier))))))

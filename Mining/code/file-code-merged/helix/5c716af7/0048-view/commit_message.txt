Fix scrolloff at view bottom (#6142)

Fixes a regression introduced in #5420 where a scrolloff of `x - 1`
was used instead if `x` at the bottom of the screen. This was
especially problematic if the scrolloff was set to `0` in that case
the scrolloff behaved as tough set to `-1` and the cursor disappeared
from the view if scrolled to the botoom.

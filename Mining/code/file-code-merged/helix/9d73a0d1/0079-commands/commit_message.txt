Fix the infinite loop when copying the cursor to the top of the file (#5888)

Example:
```
test
testitem
```

Select line 2 with x, then type Alt-C; Helix will go into an infinite
loop. The saturating_sub keeps the head_row and anchor_row pinned at 0,
and a selection is never made since the first line is too short.

fix(es/minifier): Fix analysis of parameters (#5954)

**Description:**

Although the author of the issue talked about `@react-pdf/renderer`, it's a bug related to `brotli`, not react pdf renderer.

After investigation, I found that the bug is caused by not marking parameters as initialized. So I fixed the analyzer.

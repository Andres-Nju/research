fix(common): Don't use `None` as source while generating source maps (#4007)

**Description:**

I used https://pastcompute.github.io/ScriptMapper/ to dump source map, and found that line/column becomes null if file is `None`. Seems like the rust crate `sourcemap` is mature enough to handle sourcemaps with those entries, but many other sourcemap libraries, including the one used by `@swc/cli` expects non-null value for the line and the column.

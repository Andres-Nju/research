Fix scrollback live reloading

This fixes two issues with live reloading the `scrolling.history`
property.

It is now possible to increase the scrollback history without restarting
Alacritty.

When decreasing the scrollback history while scrolled beyond the new
history limit, Alacritty will reset the viewport position to the new
limit instead of crashing.

This fixes #2147.

Show hollow cursor for windows starting unfocused

Alacritty made the assumption that every window started as focused and
because of that the hollow cursor wouldn't show up for windows which are
launched without focus.

Since even the initial focus should be reported as a focus event by
winit, this could be easily fixed just setting the default window state
to unfocused instead of focused.

This fixes #1563.

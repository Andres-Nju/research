eframe: add call to save_and_destroy in Exit event of run_return (#2895)

`EventResult::Exit` is hit before `Event::LoopDestroyed` is, and due to
possibly some order of operations or drops the window is never destroyed
on Linux. Adding a call to `winit_app.save_and_destroy();` where
`EventResult::Exit` is checked solves this.

Closes #2892

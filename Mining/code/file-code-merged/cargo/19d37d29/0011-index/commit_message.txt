Improve the error message if `publish` is `false` or empty list

### What does this PR try to resolve?

close https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/11262

Improve the error message if `publish` is the false or empty list.

Say `publish` is set to `false` or an empty list in Cargo.toml and prevents publishing.
### How should we test and review this PR?

Unit test

### Additional information

If there was a way we could tell `publish` to be empty or `false`, I think it would get better. If you know an easy way to implement it, please feel free to comment.

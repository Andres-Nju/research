Auto merge of #10579 - arlosi:git-length, r=ehuss

Set cargo --version git hash length to 9

#10323 changed how cargo captures the current git commit hash, which resulted in platform-dependent commit hash lengths.
This change sets the length to 9, which is consistent with rustc and previous releases of cargo.

Fixes #10547

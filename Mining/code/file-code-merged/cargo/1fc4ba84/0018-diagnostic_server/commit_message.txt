Report fix bugs to Rust instead of Cargo

I originally opted to report bugs to Cargo instead of Rust because I was
afraid of the implementation of `cargo fix` itself. These seem to all be
weeded out now (largely at least), and the overwhelming majority of bugs
are now rust-lang/rust suggestion bugs. Let's suggest reporting bugs
directly there!

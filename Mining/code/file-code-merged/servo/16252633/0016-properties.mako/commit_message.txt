Fix writing-mode display fixup to check the right condition.

It should be checking the value of the 'writing-mode' property, not the value of
the "writing mode" concept.  The latter is influenced by other properties like
'direction' and whatnot.  That was causing this code to convert inlines to
inline-blocks if they just had a different direction from their parent, which is
not correct

Fix clamping of scroll position in window.scrollBy

For rightward and downward overflow the spec says:

Let x be max(0, min(x, viewport scrolling area width - viewport width)).
Let y be max(0, min(y, viewport scrolling area height - viewport height)).

Previously, those operations were reversed, which created negative
overflow even when the overflow direction was downward. This change
ensures that Servo matches spec behavior.

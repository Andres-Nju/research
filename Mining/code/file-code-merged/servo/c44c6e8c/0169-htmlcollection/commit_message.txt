Fix checking for empty set in getElementsByClassName

Because empty set with `.all(predicate)` will always return `true`, it will result in always filtering wrong elements when the classes is empty set.

Thus, we return earlier with `always_empty` HTMLCollection in the empty classes case so that we can avoid filtering on empty sets.

With adding the checking, we can fix the failures in `/dom/nodes/getElementsByClassName-empty-set.html`.

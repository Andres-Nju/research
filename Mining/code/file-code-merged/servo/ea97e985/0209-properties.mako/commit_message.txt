Blind attempt to fix #13626

The error message was:

```
error: unknown character escape: d
  --> C:\projects\servo\target\debug\build\style-9b556a6c7bb4f044\out/properties.rs:44:55

```

Use `repr()` to get a Python string literal (whose character escaping
is compatible enough with Rustâ€™s) and `[1:-1]` to remove the single quotes.

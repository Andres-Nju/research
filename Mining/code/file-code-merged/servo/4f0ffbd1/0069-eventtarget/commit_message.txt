Issue 13363 - Fix spec for disabled scripting

The original spec for this PR was bad because it depended on the
DOM without scripting enabled to use Javascript to signal the test's
failure, so it could never fail.

Use an onerror handler on `window` where scripting is enabled, and
use an invalid string of JavaScript for the handler, to detect
whether or not the event handler is *really* being compiled or not.

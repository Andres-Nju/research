sync: add mem::forget to RwLockWriteGuard::downgrade. (#2957)

Currently when `RwLockWriteGuard::downgrade` the `MAX_READS - 1`
permits are added to the semaphore. When `RwLockWriteGuard::drop`
gets invoked however another `MAX_READS` permits are added. This
results in releasing more permits that were actually aquired when
downgrading a write to a read lock. This is why we need to call
`mem::forget` on the `RwLockWriteGuard` in order to avoid
invoking the destructor.

Fixes: #2941

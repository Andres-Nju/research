avm1: Use `set_html_text` when initializing textfield from a variable binding

If a textfield was created with a variable binding, and the variable
already existed, the initial text of the textfield is set to the
variable value. However, this was not obeying the HTML setting of
the text field, so HTML tags were mistakenly shown in some content.

Fixes #3522.

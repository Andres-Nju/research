fix(ext/fetch): ignore user content-length header (#15555)

Previously if a user specified a content-length header for an POST
request without a body, the request would contain two `content-length`
headers. One added by us, and one added by the user.

This commit ignores all content-length headers coming from the user,
because we need to have the sole authority on the content-length because
we transmit the body.

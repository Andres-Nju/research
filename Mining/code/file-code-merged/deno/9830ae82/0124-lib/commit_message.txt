fix(ext/flash): Fix panic when JS caller doesn't consume request body (#16173)



If the JS handler gets a POST, PUT, or PATCH request, but doesn't
`await` the body, deno would panic because it will try to read the body
even though the request has already been handled.

Not sure how/where to test this case, so I could use some help with
that.

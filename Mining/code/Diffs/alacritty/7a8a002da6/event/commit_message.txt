Acknowledge first click on unfocused windows with bsd/linux

Fixes a regression on non-macOS platforms caused by the fix for
issue #1291. The fix is to follow platform norms for mouse click
behavior on unfocused terminals. On macOS, the first click (that
gives the window focus) is swallowed, and has no effect on the
terminal. On all other platforms, the first click is passed through
to the terminal.

Fix hidden cursor inverting cell colors

Since the block cursor inverts the background and foreground colors of a
cell, the hidden cursor has done the same thing without rendering a
cursor since it was using the block cursor shape.

A new `Hidden` cursor style has been introduced for explicitly handling
the invisible cursor differently.

This fixes #2342.

Fix selection change after leaving vi-mode

This patch fixes that the right point of the selection range moves to
another point when leaves vi-mode with a selection by ToggleViMode.
The cause is that always moves a vi-mode cursor to a search origin
whether or not the current search is active.

This problem is a regression which is introduced by #5945.

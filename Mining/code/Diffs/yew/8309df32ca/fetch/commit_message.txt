Fix fetch test for same-origin referrer URL (#1788)

The `yew_services::fetch::tests::fetch_referrer_same_origin_url`
test broke for Chrome after Chrome changed the default
`Referrer-Policy` from `no-referrer-when-downgrade` to
`strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
(See: https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/07/referrer-policy-new-chrome-default)

The test makes a cross-site fetch (from the headless test
origin to the httpbin server) and the new default policy
causes the path to be stripped from the `Referer` header,
whereas the old policy didn't.

Fix this problem by explicitly setting the referrer policy
to the previous default `no-referrer-when-downgrade` when
making the test fetch.  This makes the test pass with Chrome
and should have no effect for other browsers which are
still using a default of `no-referrer-when-downgrade`
(i.e. Firefox).

Tested with both Chrome and Firefox:

* wasm-pack test --chrome --headless -- --features "wasm_test httpbin_test"
* wasm-pack test --firefox --headless -- --features "wasm_test httpbin_test"

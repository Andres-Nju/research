Fix small errors in docs for `rchunks_exact` and `rchunks_exact_mut`.

The documentation for `rchunks_exact` said it started at the beginning
of the slice, bit it actually starts at the end of the slice.

In addition, there were a couple of "of the slice of the slice"
duplicate phrases going on for `rchunks_exact` and `rchunks_exact_mut`.

This fixes #60068.

Fix backtraces on ARM EHABI.

Before this patch, our rust_eh_personality_catch routine would cut
backtracing short at the __rust_try function, due to it not handling
the _US_FORCE_UNWIND bit properly, which is passed by libunwind
implementations on ARM EHABI.

Examples of where the _US_FORCE_UNWIND bit is passed to the PR:
- GCC's libunwind: https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/f1717362de1e56fe1ffab540289d7d0c6ed48b20/libgcc/unwind-arm-common.inc#L590
- LLVM's libunwind: https://github.com/llvm-mirror/libunwind/blob/61278584b5c84c422ff5da10f46c3235c54636c9/src/UnwindLevel1-gcc-ext.c#L153

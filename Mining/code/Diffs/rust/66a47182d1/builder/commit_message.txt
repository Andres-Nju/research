rustbuild: fix local_rebuild

If we detect a local rebuild (e.g. bootstrap compiler is the same version as target compiler), we set stage to 1.
When trying to build e.g. UnstableBook, we use Mode::ToolBootstrap and stage is 1.
Just allow Mode::ToolBootstrap and stagge != 0 if we are in a local_rebuild

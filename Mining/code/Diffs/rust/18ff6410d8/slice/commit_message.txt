Minor fix in the merge_sort comments

There was an off-by-one error discovered by @tbelaire.
So, the two invariants we are enforcing are:

1. Run lengths are decreasing.
2. Sum of lengths of any two adjacent runs is less than the length of
their predecessor.

This commit changes the comment to be clearer and have correct bounds on `i`.

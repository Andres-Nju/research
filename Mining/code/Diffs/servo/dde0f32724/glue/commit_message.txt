Bug 1352067 - Initialize StyleAnimationValue with zeros.

AnimationValue::mGecko and AnimationValue::mServo are mutually
exclusive, so we have to make sure mGecko.IsNull() returns reasonable
value, or we will got assertions. Hence, we should initialize it during
constructing StyleAnimationValue from Servo side.

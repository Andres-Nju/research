Servo changes for updated Gecko theme constants in bug 1367577.

This is a little bit odd, because I didn't want to do all the work to
convert the theme constants to an enum class (although that would be
nice to do in the future).  So this makes them a regular enum, but still
uses gecko_constant_prefix rather than gecko_enum_prefix because that
makes it possible to add the NS_THEME_ prefix that's still present.

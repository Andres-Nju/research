Fix MallocSizeOf for TypedSize2D.

TypedSize2D's MallocSizeOf impl has two problems.

- It measures `width` twice, and `height` not at all.

- It erroneously asserts that `width` and `height` are scalars. This
  seems reasonable at first blush, but Stylo uses
  `BorderRadius<LengthAndPercentage>` which contains a
  `TypedSize2D<LengthAndPercentage, UnknownUnit>`, and
  `LengthAndPercentage` is non-scalar.

This patch fixes both of these problems, and also removes a low-value
`use` statement.

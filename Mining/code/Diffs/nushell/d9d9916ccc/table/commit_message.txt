When piping data to `table`, pages were not getting a newline at the
end[^1]. This problem was uncovered and exacerbated by the new
`display_output` hook which implicitly piped _everything_ to `table`.

## The Fix

`PagingTableCreator` now adds a newline to each page instead of relying
on later code to do it.

## Tests

I spent a while trying to write a regression test for this behaviour but
I couldn't get the test to fail before my fix! I think the test
infrastructure does something special with newlines when it's checking
command output. I eventually ran out of steam trying to investigate
that, sorry.

[^1]: unless the pipe to table was the implicit one that's done when
there is no `display_output` hook set. That situation was still working
OK.

This commit removes empty line from USAGE string in src/uu/od/src/od.rs. (#3074)

This change is needed to fix missing USAGE section for `od` in user docs.

With reference to this issue
https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/issues/2991, and missing USAGE
section from `od docs` at
https://uutils.github.io/coreutils-docs/user/utils/od.html, it was
found that the USAGE for od app was starts with an empty line and uudoc
only takes 1st line for using in USAGE section in docs.
This resulted in empty line in usage section for `od`
